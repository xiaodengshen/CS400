Oneday my cat Naomi suddenly begin to talk like a human with perfect standard English. I was shocked at first. However she told me her real thoughts  with corresponding meow sounds. She said she will be able to talk in English only once in her life and only lasting 24hours. We communicated a lot about her life style, what she want me to do and her favorite food. She wanted me to understand her expression (Meowing) more.
