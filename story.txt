Oneday my cat Naomi suddenly begin to talk like a human with perfect standard English. I was shocked at first. However she told me her real thoughts  with corresponding meow sounds. She said she will be able to talk in English only once in her life and only lasting 24hours. We communicated a lot about her life style, what she want me to do and her favorite food. She wanted me to understand her expression (Meowing) more.

Slowly, Naomi's English started to shift to more meows. I was sad because I would not be able to understand her that well anymore. I tried to listen to her more when she spoke in English. I took notes of what food she liked and what made her mad. I promised I would pay attention to her needs more, and not ignore her that much. I knew I was always busy with school work so I did not look after her as much as I should have. I promised her that I would be the best friend she could have! She smiled and said "You are the only friend I have! Thank you for everything! Meow meow meow". Naomi looked a little shocked. She was slowly losing her English. 

As the day continued Naomi began to lose more and more of her english. This was incredibly hard on her, she really looked like she was struggling. This saddened me since for the first time I witnessed another form of intelligent life, and it was my own cat. Suddenly I hear, "Meow Meow Meow, Goodbye I love you!". And just like that Naomi was back to normal, only giving meows. But out of no where, I wake up panting in bed. I realize, it was all just a dream.
